# GraphColorizer
A Python-based application for solving and visualizing graph coloring problems using backtracking and random graph generation.

# GraphColorizer

GraphColorizer is an interactive tool designed to tackle graph coloring problems. It allows users to manually input graphs by defining nodes and edges or to generate them automatically with adjustable parameters. The tool employs a backtracking algorithm to find the minimum number of colors required to color a graph under the condition that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. The results are vividly visualized within a simple and intuitive GUI, making it an excellent educational resource for understanding graph coloring, an essential concept in computer science and mathematics.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation**: Users can manually define graphs or opt for automatic random generation, adjusting parameters as needed.
- **Graph Coloring Solver**: Implements a backtracking algorithm to determine the least number of colors required for a valid graph coloring.
- **Visualization**: Leverages Matplotlib and NetworkX to visualize the graph and its coloring within the GUI.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter, the application offers an intuitive interface for graph input, visualization, and interaction.

## Requirements
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- Tkinter
